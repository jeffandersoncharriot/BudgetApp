# BudgetApp
Created a budget app where people can add expenses, sort them, add categories, delete and modify in a MVP (model-view-presenter) in teams of three
using collaborative techniques such as scrum, agile, github, JIRA

## Functionality of the Budget App:

### Expense Management
Users can add, delete, and modify expenses, ensuring accurate tracking of their spending.
### Sorting
The ability to sort expenses, perhaps based on date, amount, or category, providing users with a convenient way to analyze their financial data.
### Category Management
Users can categorize their expenses, allowing for better organization and analysis of spending patterns.
